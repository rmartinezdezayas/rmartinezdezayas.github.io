# Summary
In this article I explain the reasons why I decide to upload all my information to the cloud. I make a price comparison within the Google cloud ecosystem to decide the most economical way and explain how to carry out the entire process of automating photo uploads to the cloud for the resto of your life.

# The problem
I have a SATA hard drive stored in my closet with more than 300Gb of photos of me from my childhood up to a few years ago. On my laptop I have photos from 2016 to here. While on my mobile I most likely have photos that I have been taking in the last year.

We all know the advantages of having information in the cloud. I don't have to worry about my hard drive in the closet crashing or my laptop deciding to take a cold shower. Those concerns will now be taken care of by my cloud service provider (let's not forget that the danger is still there, but it is greatly diminished and, at least we can blame on others).

So, my decision is to upload all this information to the cloud and also to make sure that from now on, I don't have to be uploading the information to the cloud from time to time, but rather an automatic process takes care of it. I want to dedicate myself to doing what is fun, taking photos with my mobile.

Let's see the options
Always staying within the Google ecosystem, since I have almost my entire digital identity there, there is a clear option for storage, Google Drive.

# Google Drive
Google Drive currently has the following pricing:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/google_pricing.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/google_pricing.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

It offers us 15Gb of free storage, of which I already have almost 8 occupied only in important documents. But the rest is not enough when it comes to storing photos.

To cover the amount of photos I currently have (without compressing the images to keep the original quality), and to ensure enough space for the future photos you may take, I  would have to choose the Premium plan. This plan gives us 2Tb for "only" €9.99 per month or €99.99 per year. What a deal. (Bazinga)

# Google Photos
On the other hand, we have Google Photos. A Google service that reads the photos we have on our mobile stores them in the cloud. This is a tool that allows us to automate having photos in the cloud.

The problem is that it uses your own Google Drive storage, which brings us to the previous point. Having to reserve the Premium plan.

Also, a minor issue is that Google Photos does not deposit the photos in Google Drive in a user accessible folder. They share the same storage, but are not visible from each other. From Google Photos you can import photos that you have in Google Drive, but in Google Drive you will not be able to see the photos that you have in Google Photos.

# Google Cloud Platform
The next alternative, and to no one's surprise, is to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

GCP is Google's cloud services solution and has many highly customizable microservices. Among them, cloud storage with Google Cloud Storage Service at a considerable price. We can choose which region to create our data bucket and also define the type of storage depending on how often we will acces to it.

Let's take a look at the storage pricing in Europe:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcs_pricing.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcs_pricing.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

And now the pricing of data transactions based on the type of storage:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcs_storage_type_pricing.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcs_storage_type_pricing.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The types of storage are designed depending on the number of operations that are carried out. If a storage is *Archive*, the storage price (Gb/month) is the cheapest, but the transactions made on that storage will be charged more expensive. Therefore, it must be guaranteed that in this case, it is a bucket that is rarely accessed.

The *Archive* storage type is just what we need. Cheap storage and little interaction.

# Google Cloud Functions
Now it's time to interact with the bucket, and for this we will use the Google Cloud Functions. It is the multipurpose solution for light data processing. They can be written in Python (among many other languages) and run in an environment controlled by Google. The alocated memory can be previously defined, along with the Python libraries to be installed so that it runs correctly.

The idea with the Google CLoud Functions would be to create a function that runs every certain period of time and what it does is connect to my Google Photos account, download the latest photos that I have there and then upload them to the *Archive* type bucket that we will create.

The execution of the Google Cloud Function is charged by the number of executions and by computation time. By number of executions we will not have problems:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcf_compute_price.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcf_compute_price.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The first 2 million executions are free. And from then on, for every million executions they charge us €0.40.

But Google will charge us a little more for the execution time:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcf_execution_price.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/gcf_execution_price.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

In this case, with a Tier1 or Gen1 function and 4Gb of memory we would already have enough to load photos every certain period of time. Although this would have to be adjusted over time, if the capacity falls short, it would be necessary to assess whether to increase it or execute the function in shorter periods, and if it falls far above it, it has to be reduced.

# Solution Comparison
## Google Photos and Google Drive
On the one hand, using Google Photos and Google Drive, we have the following flow:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/flow1.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/flow1.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

For this solution we would use:
* Google Photos to synchronize our mobile photos with Google Drive storage.
* Google Drive as main storage for photos.

Characteristic:
* It is necessary to buy a Google Drive Premium plan for €99.99 per year.
* The photos are always available through Google Photos to see them whenever we want.
* Not being able to manage your photos from Google Drive, downloading them all or migrating them to another site whenever you want is more cumbersome.

## Google Photos, Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud Functions
Simplifying greatly the flow of information, we would have the following:

<figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/2022-06-10/flow2.png"><img src="/assets/img/2022-06-10/flow2.png"></a>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

For this solution we would use:
* Google Photos to detect the photos on our mobile and synchronize them with Google Drive.
* Google Drive as temporary storage for the most recent photos.
* A Google Cloud Functions function that will run from time to time and send the most recent photos from Google Photos to Google Cloud Storage.
* Google Cloud Storage as primary storage for all photos.

Characteristic:
* You have to pay for GCP services.
* It is necessary to manually delete the oldest photos through Google Photos once they take up a lot of space in our Google Drive to free up space.
* You always have the data accessible for an easy total download or migrate to another system.

# Price comparison
For the first solution, the pricing is easy to calculate. It would be €99.99 per year for the 2Tb of information in Google Drive.

For the second option, it would be necessary to estimate the expenses to be incurred in the Google Cloud Platform services and then add them.

In the case of Google Cloud Storage, we estimate that we currently have about 400Gb of information. Which, using the cheapest storage *Archive* in Europe ($0.0012 per Gb), means a total cost of €5.76 per year. To which we must add the cost of transactions on storage (10,000 for €0.50), considering that we would make 10,000 transactions in a year or less. Therefore, all of Google Cloud Storage should cost around **€6.26** per year.

Keep in mind that this value will increase as we add files to the storage. Analyzing the last 6 years that I have taken photos, I have been generating an average of 30Gb per year (this value will also increase as mobile phones take higher quality photos). Therefore, the previous price will be increased by **€0.04** each year.

To calculate the cost of the Google Cloud Functions function I still do not have data on the execution times, but estimating about 5 minutes for each execution, one execution per month, and with a 4Gb memory to be able to face possible monthly variations, the cost would be approximately (€0.000058 per second) **€0.21** per year.

So we have on the one hand €99.99 per year (no code solution) and on the other hand **€6.47** per year (code solution in GCP and with manual deletion of photos when we do not have much space left in Google Drive) .

Doing a fairly simple and linear simulation, we get the following graph:

  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Maintaining the expected rate of growth in costs, around 2076 we will be reaching 2Tb of information in storage and at a cost of around €28 per year. Not bad really.

I really like to save a few Euros and also take advantage of my knowledge on technology and cloud so to the surprise of no one again, we will go with the GCP option.

The execution of this solution will be discussed in the next article.

Have a great day!
