Hi, I'm Gabriel, passionate about the data world.

**Welcome to my first blog entry!**

### Who am I?
I'm a data lover based on Madrid, Spain.

In the recent years Iâ€™ve been working as a Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Consultant in Spain. And now I work as a Data Engineer for an international company.

### Why GitHub Blog?
I created this Blog as a tool for sharing my knowledge, findings and curiosities about the all the data ecosystem, as a programmer and software developer.

*The best way to really understand what you know is by sharing it with others. Sharing our knowledge improves our personal performance, effectiveness, and skills, which increases our personal profit.*
